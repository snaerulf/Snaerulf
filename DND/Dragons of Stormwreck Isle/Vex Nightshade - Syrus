# REASON
    -looking for "lost fortune"
        -Supposedly secreted away on the island by a member of the 'Gilded Gallows' 
            -Thieves guild member in question is Tarak, who did in fact betray the guild, though the story has been twisted in the retelling. 
                - Taraks last assignment for the guild was to assassinate a traitor, who was his lover. 
                  - They tried to escape together, but his lover was killed by a different assassin.
                  - Tarak did escape, but no treasure was involved. 
                    - If directly asked about the treasure, he explains he has left the life of crime, and advises Vex do the same.
