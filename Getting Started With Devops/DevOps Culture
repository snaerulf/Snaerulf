# There are 7 core principles that can help you achieve a DevOps culture
1. Create a highly collaborative environment
    - DevOps brings together development and operations to break down silos, align goals, and deliver on common objectives.
    - The whole team has end-to-end ownership for the software they release.

2. Automate When Possible
3. Focus on customer needs
4. Develop small and release often
5. Include security at every phase
6. Continuously experiment and learn
7. Continuously improve
